# ROBO


## To make a squad.
1. make leader account
2. make bot
3. send friend request to leader account
4. open leader account again and accept bot friend requests.









## known issues
joining a game session is janky and easy to break.(currently working on a fix)
roblox game sessions take up alot of ram.(not much i can about that right now. but the most bots iv tested with is 16)





I am currently working on a better version of the instructions.
